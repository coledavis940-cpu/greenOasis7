# Copilot Instructions for greenOasis7

## Project Overview
This repository currently contains only a `README.md` and `LICENSE` file. No source code, configuration, or manifest files are present in the root directory. The project structure and purpose are not yet defined.

## Guidance for AI Coding Agents
- **Project Initialization:** If you are tasked with bootstrapping this project, clarify the intended language, framework, and application domain with the user before proceeding.
- **File Discovery:** No `index.js`, `package.json`, or other code files are present in the root directory, but `README.md` references these files as aspirational or planned. Confirm their existence before assuming project structure.
- **Conventions:** No project-specific conventions, build workflows, or integration patterns are currently discoverable. Do not assume any framework or language until confirmed by the user or new files are added.
- **Next Steps:** Recommend confirming project requirements and intended architecture with the user before generating code or structure.

## Example Questions to Ask the User
- What is the primary goal or application for this repository?
- Which language or framework should be used?
- Are there any existing design documents or requirements?
- Should the project follow the structure suggested in `README.md` (e.g., Node.js with `index.js` and `package.json`)?

## Discoverable Patterns & Key Files
- The `README.md` references a Node.js style structure (`index.js`, `package.json`), but these files are not present. If you create them, follow standard Node.js conventions unless directed otherwise.
- No build, test, or deployment workflows are defined. If implementing, clarify with the user before introducing tools or scripts.
- No external dependencies or integration points are discoverable at this stage.

## Updating Instructions
- As the project evolves, update this file to document new patterns, workflows, and conventions.
- Reference key files and directories as they are added, and describe any project-specific approaches that differ from common practices.

_This file should be updated as the project evolves and new patterns, workflows, or conventions are established._
